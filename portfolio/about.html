                        Hello! I'm Abhinav Kumar Rath, and I'm passionate about cyber security. I'm currently a student at the Gyan Ganga Institute of Technology and Science, where I'm learning how to protect computers and networks from digital threats.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My interest in technology started when I was young. I began by learning how to code in languages like Python, C++, and C. These skills helped me understand how websites and applications are built, which is a big part of cyber security. I'm good at using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create and analyze web applications.
                    </p>
                     <p>
                        I love solving problems and finding ways to keep digital information safe. I'm always learning about the latest security trends and tools to stay up-to-date. I'm excited to use my skills to help protect against cyber attacks and make the digital world a safer place. I'm looking for a chance to work on real projects and make a difference in the field of cyber security.
